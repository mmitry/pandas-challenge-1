    "- Overall there was some interesting data to review for these schools. Based on the data it shows the District school had a much larger number of total students with a much larger overall budget compared to charter schools. Despite having a smaller budget charter schools did have a better overall passing score compared to distrcit schools. This causes me to consider that the smaller student base allows for better student care leading to a better passing rate. The average overall passing rate for charter schools is larger than the district schools, however, when looking at specific subjects it is clear that the district schools were not far behind the charter schools in reading. \n",
